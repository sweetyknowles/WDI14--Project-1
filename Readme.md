Hangman Game- Project 1 

---------------------------
The Game:

the user gets on the webpage and is offered to play the Hangman game. He will have the instructions on how to play a game on the screen, and if he feels ready he can click on the Play button to start the game.

Th game page has two categories: Category 1 which has animals and catefory 2 which has Hollywood stars name. Whatever catergory user chooses the game will then display a list of letters. The user has an option of hint button, which they can use but only 3 times. and as per insturctions has a chance of guessing the correct letters only 6 times. If the user guesses the correct word, he will be promoted with the message "you win!";  but if he looses he will be prompted with you loose. 

While the user is playing this game, there is a stick figure that will keep building it -self as the user keep choosing the wrong letters. This is the Hangman. if the user wins the hangman will be happy or does not form at all; and if the user looses the hangman will be hanged.
